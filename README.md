# This was my first time working with react and I must say this won't be my last. This was very fun little project to do. I made this app/website on why you should choose a Resort to stay on vacation. It includes pricing, food, and contacting. Overall, fun to work with!

#Also if you're copying this make sure to install node.js to get the node module. This was done on VS Studio
